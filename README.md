### Extra Functions

M Key - stores the current value in memory
MR key - recalls the value stored in memory
MC - clears the value stored in memory
M+ - adds a value to memory
P.S I also plan to add a AC key that would clear everything including the memory and I also plan to add a M- key that subtracts the current value from memory.
